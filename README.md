# Background Selection on the Human Genome
Bed files containing background selection values from McVicker et al 2009

Initial bkgd files downloaded from :
http://www.phrap.org/othersoftware.html
http://www.phrap.org/software_dir/mcvicker_dir/bkgd.tar.gz

These bkgd files are converted to bed files in different genomic builds (conversion from original values in hg18 to hg38 performed using UCSC liftOver)
